## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play the game
* Click on a one of the cards
* It will toggle the card. Upon clicking another card, if it matches it stays open otherwise it flips to closed state.
* Match all of the cards to it's pair and reveal all cards to win the game in lesser time.
